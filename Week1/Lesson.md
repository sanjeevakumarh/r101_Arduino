- HOOK (5 min)
	- "Think about your body. Your brain tells your hands to move, your eyes to look, your heart to beat. Robots work the same way. A robot can't do anything unless it has a brain."
	- Hold up the Arduino UNO.
	- "This is our robot's brain. Today, we're waking it up and making sure it's alive."
- **Quick questions:**
	- What does your brain do?
	- What do you think a robot brain does?
	- **Key point:** Robots don't think by themselves. We teach them what to do.

- ## PART 1: MEET THE BRAIN (15 min)
	- ### What is Arduino?
		- Arduino = robot brain
		- Small but powerful
		- Listens to instructions we send from the computer
	- **Why it matters:**
		- **Open-source**: People worldwide help make it better
		- **User-friendly**: Made so beginners can learn easily
		- **Hardware + Software**: Board you can touch + instructions we write
		- **Interactive**: Can control lights, motors, read sensors
	- **Robot language to use:**
		- Arduino = Robot brain
		- Wires = Robot nerves
		- LEDs = Robot's way of telling us
		- Motors = Robot muscles
		- Sensors = Robot senses
- ---
- ## PART 2: INPUTS & OUTPUTS (10 min)
- ### Explain with body example:
	- **INPUTS** = things the robot feels or sees
		- Buttons, light sensors, distance sensors
	- **OUTPUTS** = things the robot does
		- Lights, sounds, motors
- Write on board:
	- ```
	  Sense (Input) → Think (Brain/Arduino) → Act (Outputs)
	  ```
	- "The robot brain **listens**, **decides**, and **acts**."
- ---
- ## PART 3: UNBOXING & IDENTIFICATION (15 min)
- **Hands-on inventory:** Have kids carefully open kits and identify:
	- Arduino UNO → Robot brain
	- USB Cable → Robot power & voice
	- LEDs → Robot lights
	- Wires → Robot nerves
	- Other components as applicable
- **Math integration:**
	- "Count your LEDs & PINS"
	- "Count your wires"
	- "What colors do you see?"
	- No pressure - just observation and familiarity.

- ## PART 4: HOW THE ROBOT THINKS (10 min)
- ### Explain using daily routine analogy:
	- "Every robot follows a routine, just like you do every day."
- **Three parts to every robot program:**
	- **INITIALIZATION** (Getting Ready)
		- Choosing which parts to use
		- Giving names to things
	- **setup()** – Wake-Up Time
		- Runs ONCE when robot wakes up
		- Like brushing teeth in the morning
		- Tells robot what parts it will use
	- **loop()** – Robot Life
		- Runs AGAIN and AGAIN forever
		- Like your heartbeat
		- Keeps robot alive until power is off
	- **Remember:** `setup()` runs once, `loop()` runs forever.

- ## PART 5: FIRST PROGRAM - ROBOT HEARTBEAT (25 min)
- ### Setup environment:
	- Connect Arduino to computer via USB
	- Open Arduino IDE
	- Select board: Tools > Board > Arduino UNO
	- Select port: Tools > Port
- ### The goal:
	- Make the Arduino's onboard light blink like a heartbeat.
- **Explain the plan before coding:**
	- Arduino already has a tiny light on it (pin 13)
	- We'll tell the robot brain to:
		- Turn light ON
		- Wait
		- Turn light OFF
		- Wait
		- Repeat forever
- ### Key commands (verbal explanation):
	- `pinMode()` → "Choose what the pin does"
	- `digitalWrite()` → "Turn something ON or OFF"
	- `delay()` → "Wait a little bit"
- ### Code together:
	- Open the file: **`01_robot_heartbeat.ino`**
	- Walk through each line explaining what it does in simple terms. Don't dive into syntax - focus on the logic.
- ### Upload and celebrate! 🎉
	- When the LED blinks: "Your robot brain is alive! The heartbeat means it's listening to you."
- ---
- ## PART 6: EXPERIMENT & PLAY (10 min)
	- **Modifications to try:**
	- Have kids change the delay numbers in the code:
		- Make heartbeat faster
		- Make heartbeat slower
		- Make it blink in patterns (long-short-long-short)
- **Math reinforcement:**
	- Bigger number = slower heartbeat
	- Smaller number = faster heartbeat
	- 1000 = 1 second
- Optional challenge: **`02_morse_code_SOS.ino`** (if time permits)
- ---
- ## WRAP-UP (5 min)
	- **Quick reflection:**
		- What is the robot brain?
		- What does `setup()` do?
		- What does `loop()` do?
		- What can outputs do? What about inputs?
- **Preview next class:**
	- "Today you woke up a robot brain. Next time, we'll add an external LED and teach it to respond to US with a button - its first sense!"
	- **Optional homework:**
		- Try making LED spell SOS in morse code (3 short, 3 long, 3 short)
		- Draw what you think the finished robot will look like

- ## TEACHING NOTES
	- confidence over technical depth
	- Avoid jargon like "microcontroller"
	- This class is about feeling curious and excited, not mastering syntax
