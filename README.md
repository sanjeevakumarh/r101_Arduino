Robots are where physics, mechanics, electricity, and code come together. 


In this 16-week course, students write programs that make real things move, sense, and react in the physical world - not just pixels on a screen. By building robots that navigate obstacles, follow paths, and complete missions, students discover how motion, forces, circuits, and code work together while sparking the curiosity and confidence that leads toward deeper interest in engineering, science, and technology.
